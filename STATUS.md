## 🔄 In Progress - Cloudflare Stream Upload

### Upload Status
**Interrupted at**: 300/593 videos (50.6% complete)
**Reason**: No space left on device during progress save

### What Was Uploaded (300 videos)
- Saved in: `stream_upload_progress.json` (229KB)
- All successful uploads have video IDs and Stream URLs
- Ready to resume from video #301

### Resume Script Ready
✅ `upload_to_stream.py` updated with:
- Automatic resume from existing progress
- Skips already uploaded videos
- Shows accurate remaining count
- Handles disk space issues gracefully

---

## 📊 Disk Space Status

```
Filesystem: /dev/disk3s5
Total: 460GB
Used: 408GB
Available: 20GB (96% capacity)
```

**Sufficient space available** to complete remaining uploads (279 videos)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Resume Upload (NOW)
```bash
cd /Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/interdimensionalcable
python3 upload_to_stream.py
```

**What will happen:**
- Script reads existing progress
- Shows: "📥 Found existing progress: 300 videos already uploaded"
- Asks: "Upload remaining 279 videos?"
- Continues from video #301
- Saves progress every 10 videos
- Creates `stream_upload_results.json` when complete

**Expected time**: ~25-35 minutes for 279 videos

---

### 2. Generate Stream Config (AFTER upload completes)
```bash
python3 update_channels_with_stream.py
```

**Output**: `channels_clustered_stream.json` with all Stream URLs

---

### 3. Update TV Interface
Edit `tv_clustered.html` around line 80:

```javascript
// Change from:
fetch('channels_clustered.json')

// To:
fetch('channels_clustered_stream.json')
```

---

### 4. Test Locally
```bash
open tv_clustered.html
```

Verify videos stream from Cloudflare URLs.

---

### 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```bash
# Prepare deployment
mkdir -p public
cp tv_clustered.html public/
cp index.html public/
cp channels_clustered_stream.json public/channels_clustered.json

# Deploy
wrangler pages deploy public --project-name interdimensional-cable
```

**Live URL**: https://interdimensional-cable.pages.dev

---

### 6. Commit Final Changes
```bash
git add channels_clustered_stream.json tv_clustered.html
git commit -m "Complete Cloudflare Stream integration - all 593 videos uploaded"
git push
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails Again
The script now handles interruptions:
1. Progress is saved every 10 videos
2. Simply re-run `python3 upload_to_stream.py`
3. It will skip already uploaded videos
4. Continue from where it left off

### If You Need to Reset
```bash
# Backup current progress
cp stream_upload_progress.json stream_upload_progress.backup.json

# Start fresh (not recommended - you'll re-upload 300 videos)
rm stream_upload_progress.json
python3 upload_to_stream.py
```
