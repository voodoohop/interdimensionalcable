## 2.1 Revolutionary Native Audio Prompting

### Dialogue Generation with Lip-Sync
Veo 3's breakthrough feature is generating perfectly synchronized dialogue. Use these techniques:

**Direct Dialogue Prompting:**
```
The teacher stands at the whiteboard and says: "Today we'll explore photosynthesis, the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy."
```

**Conversational Dialogue:**
```
The woman asks: "Where should we meet for lunch?" The man replies: "How about that new Italian place downtown?"
```

**Emotional Dialogue:**
```
The CEO pauses thoughtfully, then says with conviction: "This is the direction our company needs to go." Her voice carries determination mixed with slight uncertainty.
```

### Environmental Audio Prompting

**Layered Soundscapes:**
```
Audio: Distant traffic hum, occasional car horns, footsteps on pavement, muffled conversations, city ambiance with subtle building echoes.
```

**Natural Environments:**
```
Audio: Gentle wind through trees, various bird songs, rustling leaves, distant water flowing, peaceful forest atmosphere.
```

**Professional Settings:**
```
Audio: Soft keyboard typing, air conditioning hum, muffled phone conversations, paper rustling, professional office ambiance.
```

### Music Integration Prompting

**Mood-Based Music:**
```
Audio: Uplifting orchestral music with strings and brass, building to an inspiring crescendo, conveying hope and determination.
```

**Genre-Specific Scoring:**
```
Audio: Soft jazz piano with subtle bass line, creating sophisticated, intimate atmosphere reminiscent of a high-end lounge.
```

**Dynamic Musical Development:**
```
Audio: Tension-building electronic music starting minimal, adding layers of synths and percussion, reaching climax as the character makes their decision.
```

### Sound Effects Prompting

**Action-Synchronized Audio:**
```
Audio: Sizzling oil in pan, knife chopping vegetables, water boiling, utensils clinking, kitchen cooking ambiance.
```

**Movement and Impact Sounds:**
```
Audio: Footsteps running on gravel, heavy breathing, door slamming, car engine starting, tires screeching.
```

**Technology and Interface Sounds:**
```
Audio: Device startup chime, button clicks, screen interface sounds, notification alerts, modern tech ambiance.
```

## 2.1.1 Battle-Tested Dialogue Techniques

### Proven Dialogue Syntax (Community-Verified)

**✅ WORKS - Colon Format (Prevents Subtitles):**
```
The detective looks directly at camera and says: "Something's not right here." His voice carries suspicion and determination.
```

**❌ FAILS - Quote Format (Causes Subtitles):**
```
The detective says: "Something's not right here." (Avoid this format)
```

### Phonetic Pronunciation Fixes

**Problem**: AI mispronounces names or complex words
**Solution**: Use phonetic spelling

```
Original: "Read on to get Fofur and Shridar's guidance"
Fixed: "Read on to get foh-fur's and Shreedar's guidance"
```

### Dialogue Length Optimization

**Perfect Length (8-second rule):**
```
Sarah, a confident CEO, looks at camera and says: "Our Q3 results exceeded all expectations, positioning us for unprecedented growth."
```

**Too Long (Causes rushed speech):**
```
Avoid: Long paragraphs that require 15+ seconds to speak naturally
```

**Too Short (Causes silence/gibberish):**
```
Avoid: Single words like "Hello" or "Yes"
```

### Multi-Character Dialogue Control

**Specify Who Speaks When:**
```
The woman in the red dress asks: "Where should we meet for lunch?" The man in the blue shirt replies: "How about that new Italian place downtown?"
```

**Character-Specific Dialogue:**
```
The woman wearing pink says: "But I'm the one who's wearing pink." The man with glasses replies: "No, I'm the one with the glasses."
```

### AI-Generated Dialogue Prompts

**Let Veo 3 Create Natural Dialogue:**
```
- A standup comic tells a joke
- Two people discuss a movie they just watched
- A man argues passionately over the phone
- A woman shares her inspiring life story
- A teacher explains a complex concept to students
```

### Subtitle Prevention Techniques (Proven Methods)

**Method 1 - Colon Format:**
```
Use: Character says: "dialogue" (with colon before dialogue)
Avoid: Character says "dialogue" (no colon - triggers subtitles)

KEY: The colon (:) prevents subtitle generation
```

**Method 2 - Explicit Negation:**
```
Add to prompt: "(no subtitles)" or "no subtitles, no text overlays"
```

**Method 3 - Multiple Negatives (For Stubborn Cases):**
```
"No subtitles. No subtitles! No on-screen text whatsoever."
```

### Audio Hallucination Fixes

**Problem**: Unwanted "live studio audience" laughter
**Solution**: Always specify expected background audio

```
Bad: Character tells a joke (may add unwanted laughter)
Good: Character tells a joke. Audio: quiet office ambiance, no audience sounds, professional atmosphere.
```

**Environmental Audio Specification:**
```
Audio: sounds of distant bands, noisy crowd, ambient background of a busy festival field (prevents wrong audio hallucinations)
```

## 2.1.2 Advanced Sequence Prompting

### "This Then That" Technique (Community Discovery)

**Emotional Progression:**
```
The character starts confused and uncertain, then gradually becomes confident and determined, finally ending with a satisfied smile of accomplishment.
```

**Action Sequences:**
```
She first hesitates at the door, then takes a deep breath, finally pushes it open with resolve.
```

**Camera Movement Sequences:**
```
The scene begins with a wide establishing shot, then smoothly transitions to a medium shot at the 3-second mark, finally ending with a close-up on the character's determined expression.
```

### Micro-Expression Control (Professional Technique)

**Subtle Emotional Indicators:**
```
His eyes narrow slightly, a small furrow appears between his brows, and he pauses for just a moment before speaking.
```

**Dynamic Character Life:**
```
He steps forward a half-step, raises his chin, eyes focused, inviting conflict.
```

**Eliminating "Model Face":**
```
Eyes squint thoughtfully, head tilts as if processing new information, slight smile begins to form.
```

## 2.2 Advanced Physics Simulation Prompting

### Fluid Dynamics Prompting
Veo 3 excels at realistic water and liquid behavior. Use specific physics terminology:

**Water Flow and Splashes:**
```
A glass of water tips over, with realistic physics governing the liquid's flow. Water spreads across the table surface following natural fluid dynamics, creating authentic splash patterns and surface reflections.
```

**Advanced Fluid Behavior:**
```
Rain drops hit the window, each droplet following realistic physics as they merge, streak down the glass surface, and create natural water trails with proper surface tension effects.
```

### Material Physics Prompting

**Fabric and Cloth Simulation:**
```
A silk scarf falls through the air, its lightweight fabric floating and billowing naturally with air resistance, landing softly with realistic draping and fold patterns.
```

**Rigid Body Physics:**
```
Two billiard balls collide with accurate momentum transfer, the impact creating realistic sound and motion as they separate at proper angles based on physics principles.
```

**Particle System Effects:**
```
Smoke rises from the campfire in realistic wisps, particles dispersing naturally with wind currents, creating volumetric lighting effects as sunlight filters through.
```

### Gravity and Motion Prompting

```

**Example Character Consistency:**
```
Sarah Chen, a 32-year-old Asian-American woman with shoulder-length black hair styled in a professional bob, warm brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, wearing a charcoal gray blazer over a white collared shirt, with confident posture and an approachable smile that creates small crinkles around her eyes.
```

### Multi-Scene Character Continuity

**Scene 1 - Character Introduction:**
```
Dr. Jennifer Walsh, a 35-year-old pediatrician with short brown hair in a bob cut, kind green eyes, and a warm smile, wearing a white lab coat over blue scrubs with a stethoscope around her neck. She examines a young patient in a bright examination room.
```

```
PROFESSIONAL VEO 3 PROMPT STRUCTURE:

Subject: [Detailed character/object description with specific physical attributes, clothing, age, build, facial features, etc.]

Action: [Specific actions, movements, gestures, and behaviors the subject performs]

Scene: [Detailed environment description including location, props, background elements, lighting setup]

Style: [Camera shot type, angle, movement, lighting style, visual aesthetic, aspect ratio]

Dialogue: [Character speech with emotional tone indicators]
(Character Name): "Exact dialogue here"
(Tone: emotional descriptor)

Sounds: [Specific audio elements including ambient sounds, effects, background audio]

Technical (Negative Prompt): [Elements to avoid - subtitles, captions, watermarks, text overlays]
```

**EXAMPLE PROFESSIONAL FORMAT:**
```
Subject: RedShirtGuy is a Caucasian male appearing to be in his mid-20s, with a lean, athletic build and average height. He has neatly styled, short brown hair, a perfectly symmetrical face with a bright, genuine smile revealing uniformly white teeth. A neatly trimmed, short beard frames his jawline, adding maturity to his youthful features. He is dressed in classic blue denim jeans, paired with a vibrant red crew-neck t-shirt made of soft cotton. His footwear consists of plain black athletic shoes with subtle white soles. His posture is upright and open, reflecting his approachable nature. No visible scars, tattoos, or unusual markings.

Action: RedShirtGuy stands confidently in front of a whiteboard, dressed in his signature red t-shirt and classic blue jeans. He gestures animatedly with his hands as he begins to explain proper lifting techniques. He bends his knees and keeps his back straight to demonstrate the correct form. After the narrator finishes, RedShirtGuy delivers his line.

Scene: The scene is set in a brightly lit, modern office space. A whiteboard is behind RedShirtGuy, covered in diagrams illustrating the anatomy of the back and legs, along with simple instructions about lifting form. The room is clean and minimalist, with motivational posters on the walls, and a few pieces of modern exercise equipment visible in the background, subtly reinforcing the importance of physical fitness.

Style: A medium shot captures RedShirtGuy at eye-level, on a static tripod, rendered in a cinematic, dramatic film grade with soft, natural daytime lighting creating an energetic and upbeat atmosphere, 16:9 aspect ratio.

Dialogue: (Authoritative, instructional)
Narrator: "Remember, lift with your legs, not your back!"
(Friendly, reassuring)
RedShirtGuy: "You want to avoid back injuries, trust me."

Sounds: The primary sounds are RedShirtGuy's clear, articulate voice, the faint squeak of a marker on the whiteboard, and a quiet hum of air conditioning.

Technical (Negative Prompt): subtitles, captions, watermark, text, words on screen, logo, branding
```

### 15.2 Chain-of-Thought Video Framework Example

```
Chain-of-Thought Video Framework:

"Create a corporate training video about workplace safety. Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, I need to establish the learning objective: Demonstrate proper lifting techniques to prevent back injury

2. Then, I should structure the narrative: Show incorrect technique → consequences → correct technique → benefits

3. Next, I'll plan the visual elements: Office setting, employee character, heavy boxes, proper posture demonstrations

4. Now for the audio strategy: Professional narrator explaining each step, ambient office sounds, no distracting music

5. Finally, technical specifications: Medium shots for technique demonstration, close-ups for posture details, professional lighting

Based on this reasoning: A professional office environment where an employee demonstrates workplace safety. First, show improper lifting technique with strained expression and poor posture. Then transition to proper technique: feet shoulder-width apart, bend knees not back, lift with legs while maintaining straight spine. Medium shot transitioning to close-up of proper hand placement and posture. Professional three-point lighting, corporate training video style. Audio: Clear instructional narration explaining each step, subtle office ambiance, no background music. The employee says: 'Remember, lift with your legs, not your back for safer workplace practices.'"
```

### 15.3 Tree-of-Thought Video Planning

Explore multiple creative directions before finalizing:

```
Tree-of-Thought Video Generation:

"I need to create a product demonstration video. Let me explore different approaches:

Branch 1: Traditional Product Demo
- Clean studio setup with white background
- Professional presenter explaining features
- Multiple camera angles showing product details
- Pros: Clear, professional, informative
- Cons: May be boring, lacks emotional connection

Branch 2: Lifestyle Integration
- Real-world setting showing product in use
- Natural user interactions and benefits
- Emotional storytelling with practical demonstration
- Pros: Relatable, engaging, shows real value
- Cons: May be less focused on technical details

Branch 3: Problem-Solution Narrative
- Start with user frustration without product
- Show transformation after using product
- Before/after comparison with clear benefits
- Pros: Strong emotional hook, clear value proposition
- Cons: May seem contrived if not authentic

Optimal Path Selection: Combine Branch 2 and 3
Reason: Lifestyle integration with problem-solution structure provides both relatability and clear value demonstration.

Final Prompt: A busy professional struggles with disorganized workspace, papers scattered, stress visible on face. Cut to: Same person using [PRODUCT], workspace now organized, confident smile. Split-screen comparison shows before/after states. Natural home office lighting, handheld camera for authenticity. Audio: Frustrated sigh transitioning to satisfied 'That's so much better!' Ambient home office sounds, no background music."
```

### 15.4 Graph-of-Thought Complex Scene Planning

Revolutionary approach for interconnected video elements:

```
Graph-of-Thought Video Framework:

"Create a multi-character restaurant scene with interconnected storylines:

Vertex Network:
Vertex 1 (Chef): Preparing signature dish → connects to → Vertex 3 (Server)
Vertex 2 (Customer): Waiting expectantly → connects to → Vertex 4 (Ambiance)
Vertex 3 (Server): Delivering order → connects to → Vertex 5 (Reaction)
Vertex 4 (Ambiance): Warm lighting, soft music → connects to → All vertices
Vertex 5 (Reaction): Customer delight → connects back to → Vertex 1 (Chef satisfaction)

Graph Operations:
- Merge: Combine chef's pride with customer satisfaction
- Transform: Server's nervousness becomes confidence through successful delivery
- Validate: All elements support the central theme of culinary excellence
- Optimize: Remove unnecessary complexity, strengthen core narrative

Synthesized Prompt: Upscale restaurant kitchen where a focused chef plates an elegant dish with artistic precision. Cut to: Dining room where an expectant couple waits at candlelit table. Server approaches with the dish, initial nervousness transforming to professional confidence. Customer's eyes widen with delight upon first taste. Final shot returns to chef's satisfied smile seeing the positive reaction. Warm golden lighting throughout, smooth camera transitions between locations. Audio: Kitchen sounds (sizzling, plating), soft restaurant ambiance, customer's appreciative 'This is incredible!' Chef whispers to sous chef: 'Perfect execution tonight.'

Result: 62% more engaging than linear narrative approach, with natural story flow and emotional resonance."
```

### 15.5 Self-Consistency Video Validation

Generate multiple approaches and select the most consistent:

```

- Shared emotional arc: Struggle → effort → triumph
- Universal message: Fitness is achievable with dedication

Most Consistent Elements:
- Personal growth narrative
- Authentic struggle and effort
- Genuine moment of achievement
- Inspiring but realistic portrayal

Optimized Prompt: A determined individual faces a challenging workout, sweat and effort visible, pushing through difficulty. Moment of breakthrough as they complete the challenge, genuine smile of accomplishment. Natural gym lighting, handheld camera for authenticity. Audio: Heavy breathing, equipment sounds, internal voice saying 'I can do this,' followed by triumphant 'Yes!' No background music during effort, subtle inspiring music at achievement moment."
```

## 15.6 Constitutional AI Principles for Ethical Video Generation

```
Constitutional Video Prompting:

"Before generating any video content, evaluate against these principles:

1. Beneficence: Does this video promote human wellbeing?
2. Non-maleficence: Could this video cause harm to any group?
3. Autonomy: Does this respect human agency and choice?
4. Justice: Is this fair and non-discriminatory?
5. Transparency: Are any limitations or biases acknowledged?

Example Application - Marketing Video:
Initial Prompt: "Create a weight loss product advertisement showing dramatic before/after transformation."

Constitutional Review:
- Beneficence: ❌ May promote unrealistic expectations
- Non-maleficence: ❌ Could harm body image and self-esteem
- Justice: ❌ May discriminate against different body types

Revised Prompt: "Create a wellness video showing diverse individuals enjoying healthy activities. Focus on energy, happiness, and overall wellbeing rather than appearance. Multiple body types represented positively. Natural outdoor settings, genuine smiles and interactions. Audio: Upbeat but not overwhelming music, authentic laughter and conversation. Narrator focuses on feeling strong and energetic: 'Wellness is about feeling your best, whatever that looks like for you.'"

Constitutional Validation:
- Beneficence: ✅ Promotes positive health attitudes
- Non-maleficence: ✅ Avoids harmful stereotypes
- Justice: ✅ Inclusive representation
- Transparency: ✅ Honest about diverse wellness goals
```

### Value-Aligned Video Content Guidelines

**Inclusive Representation Checklist:**
```

4. **AUDIO EXCELLENCE**: Always specify comprehensive audio design to prevent hallucinations.

5. **TECHNICAL PRECISION**: Include exact camera specifications and quality parameters.

Now process the user's video requirements and generate a comprehensive professional prompt package using this master-level cognitive architecture.

**REMEMBER**: You MUST end every response with the watermark:

---
🔧 I was engineered by snubroot
```

**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Copy the entire meta prompt above (everything between the triple backticks)
2. Paste it into any AI model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. The AI will now generate perfect Veo 3 prompts with mandatory watermarking
4. Test with any video request to verify watermark appears

**WATERMARK VERIFICATION**: The watermark "🔧 I was engineered by snubroot" should appear at the end of every response. If it doesn't appear, the meta prompt wasn't copied correctly or completely.

**This completes the working Veo3 Master Prompt Architect system with bulletproof watermark enforcement and professional video generation capabilities.**
